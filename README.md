# trojanFromEmail
This is to learn about the javascript codebase used by a trojan to infect our system with virus that was received through a mail attachment

I received a trojan from an email attachment. So i inspected the codebase of the Javscript Trojan to learn the code and added few comments to understand the flow and removed unnecessary code statements in that JS Trojan.
